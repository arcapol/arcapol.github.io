&lt;p&gt;This is the best day of the year. With temperatures crossing 50 degrees in the heat of Delhi, today&amp;rsquo;s bath will be a relief. It has been 5 years now that Indians have started conserving water to this extent. The progress has been astonishing. Water globally has depleted to such an extent that water is now rationed based on family needs. This is the first crisis in which the world came together under the ambit of UNO to take actions to prevent further depletion. While the governments over the world are working hard to increase the supply of fresh water, it has not led to any fruitful results given the global warming and the annhilation of the Arctic by the Russians.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>

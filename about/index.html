I have always been afraid of writing. I always regard authors with high respect. The articles or books they write are well researched and thought out and the writing flows as a conversation into the reader’s mind.
My writing does not match, unfortunately, any of the qualities mentioned above. Nevertheless, I plan to start writing not as a way to impart wisdom, but to document my imperfections and work on it. Writing about any topic makes me insecure as I quickly reach the depths of my knowledge. I will try my best to write all the articles after researching and employing critical thinking skills. However, readers beware, you are about to see a world through my eyes.

Listen.

If someone tells you what a story is about, they are 
probably right.

If they tell you that that is all the storyis about, 
they are very definitely wrong.Any story is about a 
host of things. It is about the author; it is about
the world the author sees and deals with and lives in;
it is about the words chosen and the way those words 
are deployed; it is about the story itself and what 
happens in the story; it is about the people in the 
story; it is polemic; it is opinion.

An author’s opinions of what a story is about are 
always valid and are always true: the author was 
there, after all, when the book was written. 
She came up with each word and knows why she used
that word instead of another. But an author is a 
creature of her time, and even she cannot see 
everything that her book is about.

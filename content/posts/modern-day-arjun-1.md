This is my first post of a series where I go in detail about my learnings from The Bhagavad Gita[^1]. I intend to write it in a form of a dialogue between Modern Day Arjuna and Krishna. However, this should not be misconstriued as a commentary on religion or even on the Gita. This is my understanding, and as such the problems that I will enumerate are my problems. I am writing this to understand how Gita will solve my 21st Century problems.

**M.A.:** In this life, I have too many expectations from myself and from the world. I have no purpose, I feel alone while people around me have full and rich lives. To live everyday is a pain. I know not why I should do anything when I fail at everything I do. This world is my Kurukshetra and I am not even sure what the battle is and should I even fight it. O Krishna, what should I do, how do I live life to its fullest, a life that I am proud of.

**Krishna:** Dear Arjuna, that is a little too much to unpack. Instead of looking at your life as a whole, let us look at the finer strings one by one and resolve all the knots in the process. This then will be a treatise that you will follow, a guide that will not lead you astray and a friend who will always be there to help you in tough times.

**M.A.:** Fair enough, let us start from the beginning. I did not choose to take birth. Now that I am here, why should I do anything. Why bother working at all?

**Krishna:**

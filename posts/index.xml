I intend to write it in a form of a dialogue between Modern Day Arjuna and Krishna. However, this should not be misconstriued as a commentary on religion or even on the Gita. This is my understanding, and as such the problems that I will enumerate are my problems. I am writing this to understand how Gita will solve my 21st Century problems.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The Short Bath</title><link>https://arcapol.github.io/posts/short-bath/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Jul 2023 00:53:58 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://arcapol.github.io/posts/short-bath/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Come on we are going to be late, I do not want to let go of my bath time&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

It has been 5 years now that Indians have started conserving water to this extent. The progress has been astonishing. Water globally has depleted to such an extent that water is now rationed based on family needs. This is the first crisis in which the world came together under the ambit of UNO to take actions to prevent further depletion.

The words still ring in my ears. I hear it in the cacophony of a wedding, I hear it in the silence of night, I hear it waking up, I hear it laying down. There were a hundred lines left to say, a thousand moments to look upon and her words tore apart a movie which could have been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Hi, How are you?”, said an uncle. Who he is I am not sure, why is he talking to me, no idea. “Namaste, how are you?”. These days I use &lt;em&gt;Namaste&lt;/em&gt; as a catchall phrase. I don’t have to know anyone and I can do that without disrespecting them. I do not remember what happened afterwards, what we spoke about, if we spoke.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
